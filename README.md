# JavaScript DOM append strategies v2

## Purpose
Demonstration of three strategies for appending several elements to the DOM:
1. One append per element
2. Creating the elements in memory and appending only once
3. Cloning a template with cloneNode()
4. Combining cloneNode() with a template literal
5. Writing the elements in a template literal and adding it to the parent's `innerHTML`

Check the console in the browser developer tools for the time each approach takes.

## Tools
